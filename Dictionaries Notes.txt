Dictionaries
-------------------

- The key will always be on the left and the value on the right
    Key will always be text and value can be whatever
    Values can be any python value

Key Syntax
--------------------
[{"key" : "value",...}] 

 -KeyError = Means there is some kind a mistake indicating that Python could not find a key with the title you programmed

person[fname] = "Joe"    <-- Will print "Joe" as the key and value
person["fname"] = "Joe"  <-- Hard codes the key printing "fname"
